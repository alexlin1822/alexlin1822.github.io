### A company has a mobile application that makes HTTP API calls to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB routes requests to an AWS Lambda function. Many different versions of the application are in use at any given time, including versions that are in testing by a subset of users. The version of the application is Defined in the user-agent header that is sent with all requests to the API.After a series of recent changes to the API, the company has observed issues with the application. The company needs to gather a metric for each API operation by response code for each version of the application that is in use. A DevOps engineer has modi  ed the Lambda function to extract the API operation name, version information from the user-agent header and response code.Which additional set of actions should the DevOps engineer take to gather the required metrics?
- [x] Modify the Lambda function to write the API operation name, response code, and version number as a log line to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Configure a CloudWatch Logs metric   lter that increments a metric for each API operation name. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric. 
- [ ] Modify the Lambda function to write the API operation name, response code, and version number as a log line to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Configure a CloudWatch Logs Insights query to populate CloudWatch metrics from the log lines. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric. 
- [ ] Configure the ALB access logs to write to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Modify the Lambda function to respond to the ALB with the API operation name, response code, and version number as response metadata. Configure a CloudWatch Logs metric   lter that increments a metric for each API operation name. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric. 
- [ ] Configure AWS X-Ray integration on the Lambda function. Modify the Lambda function to create an X-Ray subsegment with the API operation name, response code, and version number. Configure X-Ray insights to extract an aggregated metric for each API operation name and to publish the metric to Amazon CloudWatch. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric.

### A company provides an application to customers. The application has an Amazon API Gateway REST API that invokes an AWS Lambda function. On initialization, the Lambda function loads a large amount of data from an Amazon DynamoDB table. The data load process results in long cold-start times of 8-10 seconds. The DynamoDB table has DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) Configured.Customers report that the application intermittently takes a long time to respond to requests. The application receives thousands of requests throughout the day. In the middle of the day, the application experiences 10 times more requests than at any other time of the day. Near the end of the day, the application's request volume decreases to 10% of its normal total.A DevOps engineer needs to reduce the latency of the Lambda function at all times of the day. Which solution will meet these requirements?
- [ ] Configure provisioned concurrency on the Lambda function with a concurrency value of 1. Delete the DAX cluster for the DynamoDB table.

### A company has deployed an application in a production VPC in a single AWS account. The application is popular and is experiencing heavy usage. The company’s security team wants to add additional security, such as AWS WAF, to the application deployment. However, the application's product manager is concerned about cost and does not want to approve the change unless the security team can prove that additional security is necessary.The security team believes that some of the application's demand might come from users that have IP addresses that are on a deny list. The security team provides the deny list to a DevOps engineer. If any of the IP addresses on the deny list access the application, the security team wants to receive automated noti  cation in near real time so that the security team can document that the application needs additional security. The DevOps engineer creates a VPC   ow log for the production VPC.Which set of additional steps should the DevOps engineer take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
- [x] Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure the VPC   ow log to capture accepted trafic and to send the data to the log group. Create an Amazon CloudWatch metric   lter for IP addresses on the deny list. Create a CloudWatch alarm with the metric   lter as input. Set the period to 5 minutes and the datapoints to alarm to 1. Use an Amazon Simple Noti  cation Service (Amazon SNS) topic to send alarm notices to the security team. 
- [ ] Create an Amazon S3 bucket for log   les. Configure the VPC   ow log to capture all trafic and to send the data to the S3 bucket. Configure Amazon Athena to return all log   les in the S3 bucket for IP addresses on the deny list. Configure Amazon QuickSight to accept data from Athena and to publish the data as a dashboard that the security team can access. Create a threshold alert of 1 for successful access. Configure the alert to automatically notify the security team as frequently as possible when the alert threshold is met. 
- [ ] Create an Amazon S3 bucket for log   les. Configure the VPC   ow log to capture accepted trafic and to send the data to the S3 bucket. Configure an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster and domain for the log   les. Create an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the logs from the S3 bucket, format the logs, and load the logs into the OpenSearch Service cluster. Schedule the Lambda function to run every 5 minutes. Configure an alert and condition in OpenSearch Service to send alerts to the security team through an Amazon SimpleNoti  cation Service (Amazon SNS) topic when access from the IP addresses on the deny list is detected. 
- [ ] Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold query results. Configure the VPC   ow log to capture all trafic and to send the data to the log group. Deploy an Amazon Athena CloudWatch connector in AWS Lambda. Connect the connector to the log group.
