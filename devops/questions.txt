### A company has a mobile application that makes HTTP API calls to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB routes requests to an AWS Lambda function. Many different versions of the application are in use at any given time, including versions that are in testing by a subset of users. The version of the application is de¬ned in the user-agent header that is sent with all requests to the API. After a series of recent changes to the API, the company has observed issues with the application. The company needs to gather a metric for each API operation by response code for each version of the application that is in use. A DevOps engineer has modi¬ed the Lambda function to extract the API operation name, version information from the user-agent header and response code. Which additional set of actions should the DevOps engineer take to gather the required metrics?

- [x] Modify the Lambda function to write the API operation name, response code, and version number as a log line to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Confgure a CloudWatch Logs metric ¬lter that increments a metric for each API operation name. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric
- [ ] Modify the Lambda function to write the API operation name, response code, and version number as a log line to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Confgure a CloudWatch Logs Insights query to populate CloudWatch metrics from the log lines. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric
- [ ] Confgure the ALB access logs to write to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Modify the Lambda function to respond to the ALB with the API operation name, response code, and version number as response metadata. Confgure a CloudWatch Logs metric ¬lter that increments a metric for each API operation name. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric
- [ ] Confgure AWS X-Ray integration on the Lambda function. Modify the Lambda function to create an X-Ray subsegment with the API operation name, response code, and version number. Confgure X-Ray insights to extract an aggregated metric for each API operation name and to publish the metric to Amazon CloudWatch. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric.

### A company provides an application to customers. The application has an Amazon API Gateway REST API that invokes an AWS Lambda function. On initialization, the Lambda function loads a large amount of data from an Amazon DynamoDB table. The data load process results in long cold-start times of 8-10 seconds. The DynamoDB table has DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) confgured. Customers report that the application intermittently takes a long time to respond to requests. The application receives thousands of requests throughout the day. In the middle of the day, the application experiences 10 times more requests than at any other time of the day. Near the end of the day, the application's request volume decreases to 10% of its normal total. A DevOps engineer needs to reduce the latency of the Lambda function at all times of the day. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Confgure provisioned concurrency on the Lambda function with a concurrency value of 1. Delete the DAX cluster for the DynamoDB table.
- [ ] Confgure reserved concurrency on the Lambda function with a concurrency value of 0
- [x] Confgure provisioned concurrency on the Lambda function. Confgure AWS Application Auto Scaling on the Lambda function with provisioned concurrency values set to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100.

### A company is adopting AWS CodeDeploy to automate its application deployments for a Java-Apache Tomcat application with an Apache Webserver. The development team started with a proof of concept, created a deployment group for a developer environment, and performed functional tests within the application. After completion, the team will create additional deployment groups for staging and production. The current log level is confgured within the Apache settings, but the team wants to change this confguration dynamically when the deployment occurs, so that they can set different log level confgurations depending on the deployment group without having a different application revision for each group. How can these requirements be met with the LEAST management overhead and without requiring different script versions for each deployment group

- [ ] Tag the Amazon EC2 instances depending on the deployment group. Then place a script into the application revision that calls the metadata service and the EC2 API to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to confgure the log level settings. Reference the script as part of the AfterInstall lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml ¬le.
- [x] Create a script that uses the CodeDeploy environment variable DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_ NAME to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to confgure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the BeforeInstall lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml ¬le
- [ ] Create a CodeDeploy custom environment variable for each environment. Then place a script into the application revision that checks this environment variable to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to confgure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the ValidateService lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml ¬le.
- [ ] Create a script that uses the CodeDeploy environment variable DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_ID to identify which deployment group the instance is part of to confgure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the Install lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml ¬le.

A DevOps engineer must implement this change without affecting the operation of any AWS accounts. The implementation must ensure that individual member accounts in the organization cannot turn off the noti¬cation. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Designate an account to be the delegated Amazon GuardDuty administrator account. Turn on GuardDuty for all accounts across the organization. In the GuardDuty administrator account, create an SNS topic. Subscribe the SecOps team's email address to the SNS topic. In the same account, create an Amazon EventBridge rule that uses an event pattern for GuardDuty ¬ndings and a target of the SNS topic
- [ ] Create an AWS CloudFormation template that creates an SNS topic and subscribes the SecOps team’s email address to the SNS topic. In the template, include an Amazon EventBridge rule that uses an event pattern of CloudTrail activity for s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock and a target of the SNS topic. Deploy the stack to every account in the organization by using CloudFormation StackSets
- [x] Turn on AWS Confg across the organization. In the delegated administrator account, create an SNS topic. Subscribe the SecOps team's email address to the SNS topic. Deploy a conformance pack that uses the s3-bucket-level-public-access-prohibited AWS Confg managed rule in each account and uses an AWS Systems Manager document to publish an event to the SNS topic to notify the SecOps team
- [ ] Turn on Amazon Inspector across the organization. In the Amazon Inspector delegated administrator account, create an SNS topic. Subscribe the SecOps team’s email address to the SNS topic.

### A space exploration company receives telemetry data from multiple satellites. Small packets of data are received through Amazon API Gateway and are placed directly into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. A custom application is subscribed to the queue and transforms the data into a standard format. Because of inconsistencies in the data that the satellites produce, the application is occasionally unable to transform the data. In these cases, the messages remain in the SQS queue. A DevOps engineer must develop a solution that retains the failed messages and makes them available to scientists for review and future processing. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Confgure AWS Lambda to poll the SQS queue and invoke a Lambda function to check whether the queue messages are valid. If validation fails, send a copy of the data that is not valid to an Amazon S3 bucket so that the scientists can review and correct the data. When the data is corrected, amend the message in the SQS queue by using a replay Lambda function with the corrected data
- [ ] Convert the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Confgure AWS Lambda to poll the SQS queue every 10 minutes by using an Amazon EventBridge schedule. Invoke the Lambda function to identify any messages with a SentTimestamp value that is older than 5 minutes, push the data to the same location as the application's output location, and remove the messages from the queue
- [x] Create an SQS dead-letter queue. Modify the existing queue by including a redrive policy that sets the Maximum Receives setting to 1 and sets the dead-letter queue ARN to the ARN of the newly created queue. Instruct the scientists to use the dead-letter queue to review the data that is not valid. Reprocess this data at a later time
- [ ] Confgure API Gateway to send messages to different SQS virtual queues that are named for each of the satellites. Update the application to use a new virtual queue for any data that it cannot transform, and send the message to the new virtual queue. Instruct the scientists to use the virtual queue to review the data that is not valid. Reprocess this data at a later time
